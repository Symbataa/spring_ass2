We’re going to create a Car interface and concrete classes implementing the Car interface. We will then create an abstract decorator class CarDecorator implementing the Car interface and having the Shape object as its instance variable. ‘Car’ is the name of the interface. ‘BMW’ class and ‘Chevrolet’ class will be concrete classes implementing the ‘Car’ interface. ‘CarDecorator’ is our abstract decorator class implementing the same ‘Car’ interface. PaintCar is a concrete class implementing CarDecorator.
JavaDecoratorMain, our demo class will use PaintCar to decorate Car objects.
